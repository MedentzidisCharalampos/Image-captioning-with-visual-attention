# Image-captioning-with-visual-attention
Given an image like the example below, our goal is to generate a caption such as "a surfer riding on a wave".

  <img src="https://github.com/MedentzidisCharalampos/Image-captioning-with-visual-attention/blob/main/image_caption.jpg" />
</p>  
<p align="center">  Figure 1.Image the caption is ti be generated. <p>

 We use an attention-based model, which enables us to see what parts of the image the model focuses on as it generates a caption.
